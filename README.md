# storyboardPlayground

I created this basic app to practice using nested stack views, UIImageViews, and programmatically alter constraints. I noticed that my UIImageView constraints dont format correctly on devices other than iPhone12 (virtual simulator used). Next goal will be to explore how to use size classes to fix these issues.
